# Predicting Inflation using GDP Data

This project applies **linear regression in Python** to predict inflation based on GDP data.  
It was developed as part of my personal exploration of **econometric modeling and financial data analysis**.

## 📊 Methods
- Data cleaning and transformation with **pandas**.
- Feature engineering using macroeconomic indicators (GDP).
- Linear Regression with **scikit-learn**.
- Model evaluation using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R²**.
- Forecast of inflation for 2023 based on 2022 GDP values.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- openpyxl

## 🚀 Results
- Model trained and tested on historical GDP data.
- Produced predictions for inflation with performance metrics:
  - MSE
  - R² score

## 📂 Files
- `main.py` – core script for data analysis and modeling.
- `last_excel.xlsx` – input dataset (transposed and cleaned within script).
